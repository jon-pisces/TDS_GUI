***** Version Control Workflow using Git *****
1) Edit local files in the local repo.
2) When satisfied, open GitHub Desktop and commit the changes (you need to add a description).
3) Publish the repo to GitHub.

Using this workflow, anyone can work on the code from anywhere (just need to know the GitHub owner is now piscesCER, and the repo name on GitHub is TDS_GUI), and the code will be up-to-date.

The piscesCER GitHub account is linked to the following email address: piscescer@gmail.com
The piscesCER GitHub account PW and the gmail PW are: ferp***EBU2B29, where *** is the acronym for our ORU.
****************************************************

On ~6/23/2017, we started version control with GIT by copying TDS_GUI_v12.m and TDS_GUI_v12.fig to a new folder. 
Renamed TDS_GUI_v12.m and .fig 'TDS_GUI.m' and '.fig'
A new local git repository was created in this new folder.

On or about 7/7/2017, a new branch called 'Test' was created in order to develop new features such reading/analyzing PiscesB TDS data.

On 7/11/2017, J.Yu transferred the TDS_GUI remote repository from the jon-pisces GitHub account to the piscesCER GitHub account. 
The local repo and folder TDS_GUI were deleted.
Then, the piscesCER GitHub repo named TDS_GUI was cloned to the local computer (and a new local repo was created, also named TDS_GUI).
Now, the owner of local TDS_GUI repo is piscesCER.
