Change Log for Mike's TDS GUI Matlab code

8/7/2019

SRS uses characteristic shape of mass peaks as "basis" functions for data fits:
a + b*f_H2 + c*f_HD + d*f_D2 

To do: get characteristic shapes of peaks for MKS. Currently MKS still uses quadratic fit to mass peaks.

Adjustable polynomial order for scaling H2 to D2 (or HD).

Background subtraction method uses a linearly decaying weighting between "before" and "after" fits. "Before" refers to before the TDS ramp, and "after" refers to after!

Todo: allow only before or after fit to be used for background subtraction

Calibration factor (or ionization factor) is adjustable for D2 and HD when calculating total D flux.

Calibration for He, but needs to be completed.

Log/linear buttons for final fit.

Total D retention values displayed in upper right hand corner of final fit.

Sample area is an input instead of diameter.
D2 leak rate is now 2.15E-10 mol/s (new leak bottle a couple months ago).
